## Description
This epic covers the implementation of a new background task to enrich the application's track data. The task will identify tracks in the local database that are missing a link to Spotify, search for them on the Spotify API using their ISRC, and store the results. This automates the process of linking local track entities to their corresponding Spotify data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new API endpoint `POST /collect/spotify/enrich` exists to trigger the background job.
- The background job efficiently finds local tracks that have an ISRC but no existing Spotify data link.
- The job calls the Spotify Search API to find tracks by ISRC.
- For found tracks, a new `ExternalData` record is created linking the local track to the Spotify ID and storing the raw API response.
- For tracks not found on Spotify, a placeholder `ExternalData` record is created to prevent re-processing them in subsequent runs.
- The job is robust, processing tracks in batches, and includes error handling and configurable settings.
- The job's progress (total, processed, found, not_found, errors) can be monitored via the tasks API.

## Definition of Done
- All child tasks (TASK-2025-002, TASK-2025-003, TASK-2025-004, TASK-2025-005) are completed and their status is `done`.

## Notes
This feature is critical for enabling any Spotify-related functionality in the application, such as playback or playlist management.
